# Equity Derivatives Pricing & Risk Engine

**v0.3.0 — standalone Python research package.** Heston / Black–Scholes
vanilla pricing, Heston Monte Carlo pricing of Asian, lookback and barrier
options, Greeks, implied volatility, calibrated European vanilla surfaces,
source-compatible option-chain snapshot ingestion and numerical validation.

**This is a numerical research engine, not a production trading system.** A
successful optimizer run is not proof of a uniquely identified Heston model;
American ETF options cannot be priced exactly by the European Fourier pricer.
See [Calibration & limitations](docs/CALIBRATION.md).

## Installation

Python >=3.10. Pricing core needs NumPy and SciPy. Pandas and PyArrow are
optional for collector snapshots (PyArrow required for Parquet, not CSV.GZ).

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev,marketdata]'
python -m pytest -q
python examples/price_exotics.py
python examples/compare_schemes.py
python examples/calibrate_synthetic.py
```

Install `pip install -e .` for pricing/calibration from pure Python quotes;
use `pip install -e '.[marketdata]'` for the data adapter. The import name is
**`equity_derivatives`**, unchanged since v0.1. Previous FX and Fixed Income
repositories are neither modified nor runtime dependencies. The Python
distribution name remains `equity-derivatives-pricing-risk-engine` from v0.2.

## The new v0.3 calibration layer

- Batch Heston Fourier European call/put prices via shared Gauss–Legendre
  quadrature, grouping strikes by expiry (additional numerical method with
  configurable nodes and integration cutoff).
- Constrained, reproducible multi-start nonlinear least-squares calibration of
  `(kappa, theta, xi, rho, v0)` to vanilla mids: price RMSE, Vega-scaled price
  residuals (default), or re-inverted implied-vol residuals.
- IVs recomputed internally from quoted mids; optional bid/ask based weights,
  holdout IV/price errors, within-bid/ask coverage, Jacobian condition proxy,
  optimizer starting-point diagnostics.
- Optional data adapter for the user's **existing** daily Yahoo option-chain
  collector: historical CSV.GZ/Parquet or ZIP, deterministic timestamp
  selection (no reliance on stale `latest` files), quote-quality filters,
  OTM-by-forward filtering, and strike monotonicity/convexity diagnostics.
- **Explicit exercise-style control.** For American-style ETF option data,
  `allow_american_proxy=True` must be specified. The output is labelled as a
  European proxy; no early-exercise premium is modelled. Flat rate/dividend
  assumptions must be passed by the caller.

### Minimal synthetic European surface calibration

```python
import numpy as np
from equity_derivatives import (
    EquityMarket, HestonParams, VanillaQuote, CalibrationConfig,
    heston_surface_prices, calibrate_heston,
)
market = EquityMarket(spot=100, rate=0.02, dividend_yield=0.01)
truth = HestonParams(kappa=2.5, theta=.05, xi=.6, rho=-.65, v0=.045)
strikes = np.tile([90., 100., 110.], 3)
maturities = np.repeat([.25, .75, 1.5], 3)
prices = heston_surface_prices(market, truth, strikes, maturities)
quotes = [VanillaQuote(float(k), float(t), float(p))
          for k,t,p in zip(strikes,maturities,prices)]
fit = calibrate_heston(market, quotes, config=CalibrationConfig(n_starts=4))
print(fit.params, fit.market_rmse_iv, fit.jacobian_condition_number)
```

For an **independently integrated synthetic** demo with a held-out subset:

```bash
python examples/calibrate_synthetic.py
```

### Use the supplied historical Yahoo archive

**The raw data are intentionally not bundled in this GitHub repository.**
To reproduce an exploratory proxy fit on the archived SPY CSV dated
2026-10-27, with **illustrative (NOT historically verified) assumptions**
`r=4%`, `q=1%` (continuously compounded):

```bash
python examples/calibrate_snapshot.py 'IV Data(3).zip' \
  --ticker SPY --date 2026-10-27 \
  --rate 0.04 --dividend-yield 0.01 \
  --exercise-style american --allow-american-proxy \
  --output calibration_spy_exploratory.json
```

On this run: **96 selected quotes over eight expiries**, 72 training and 24
held-out within the **same date**; training / holdout IV RMSE approximately
**0.400 / 0.407 volatility percentage points**, with **1/24 holdout predictions
inside bid/ask**. This is *not* a temporal backtest, calibrated European-index
surface, or evidence of executable market pricing. See
[Empirical run notes](docs/EMPIRICAL_SPY.md).

If choosing the newest snapshot directly from the ZIP, `.parquet` reading
requires the `[marketdata]` optional dependencies. The adapter intentionally
does not silently use an older CSV if Parquet support is missing.

## Core v0.1/v0.2 functionality preserved

| Layer | Capability | Qualification |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla | Black-76 / Black–Scholes, IV inversion, scalar Heston Fourier | European flat-rate / flat-continuous-dividend |
| Simulation | Correlated Heston Full Truncation Euler / QE-M | Not exact Heston paths |
| Payoffs | European, arithmetic Asian, fixed-strike lookback, up/down in/out barrier | Asian/lookback grid fixings, no rebate |
| Barrier | Discrete or conditional bridge survival | Bridge exact under BS, approximate under Heston |
| Risk | CRN bump spot Delta/Gamma and initial variance sensitivity | **Not** recalibrated market-IV Vega |
| Statistics | Pair-aware antithetic SE, CIs | Does not include time-step/model bias |
| Validation | Scalar Fourier, BS continuous barrier, CIR moments, martingality | Not independent model validation |

The **defaults** `MCConfig.scheme='full_truncation_euler'` and
`Barrier.monitoring='discrete'` are unchanged from v0.1. All existing public
APIs remain available. The new data/calibration modules are additive.

## Validation and limitations

- On the release environment: **74/74 tests pass** (59 carried over from
  v0.2 plus 15 new tests). Include synthetic parameter recovery, numerical
  Fourier comparisons, quote screening, archive selection and arbitrage checks.
- The synthetic scalar-Fourier calibration reproduces Heston inputs closely,
  but model-to-model recovery cannot establish genuine market fit or
  identifiability.
- The actual SPY example shows an IV fit to a European **proxy**, not an
  exercise-adjusted calibration. Data timestamps, flat input curves, thin
  bid/ask coverage and Fourier truncation need further analysis.
- Static-arbitrage diagnostics cover **strike monotonicity and convexity**,
  not the entire no-static-arbitrage surface or calendar relationships.
- No bootstrap historical curve/forward estimation, model recalibration
  Greeks, American pricing, portfolio risk aggregation or market-data
  downloads are included in v0.3.
